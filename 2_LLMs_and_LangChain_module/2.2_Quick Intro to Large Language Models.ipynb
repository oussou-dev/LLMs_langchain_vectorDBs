    "\n",
    "We'll start with a quick introduction to the inner workings of GPT-3 and GPT-4, focusing on their few-shot learning capabilities, emergent abilities, and the scaling laws that drive their success. We will then dive into some easy-to-understand examples of how these models excel in tasks such as text summarization and translation just by providing a few examples without the need for fine-tuning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But it's not all smooth sailing in the world of LLMs. We will also discuss some of the potential pitfalls, including hallucinations and biases, which can lead to inaccurate or misleading outputs. It's essential to be aware of these limitations when using LLMs in use cases where 100% accuracy is paramount. On the flip side, their creative process can be invaluable in tasks where imagination takes center stage.  \n",

    "\n",
    "LLMs are deep learning models with billions of parameters that excel at a wide range of natural language processing tasks. They can perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot conversations without being specifically trained for them. LLMs can be used without fine-tuning by employing \"prompting\" techniques, where a question is presented as a text prompt with examples of similar problems and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs typically consist of multiple layers of neural networks, feedforward layers, embedding layers, and attention layers. These layers work together to process input text and generate output predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Future implications:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs have the potential to revolutionize various industries, it is important to be aware of their limitations and ethical implications. Businesses and workers should carefully consider the trade-offs and risks associated with using LLMs, and developers should continue refining these models to minimize biases and improve their usefulness in different applications. Throughout the course, we will address certain limitations and offer potential solutions to overcome them.  \n",

    "**Maximum number of tokens**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the LangChain library, the LLM context size, or the maximum number of tokens the model can process, is determined by the specific implementation of the LLM. In the case of the OpenAI implementation in LangChain, the maximum number of tokens is defined by the underlying OpenAI model being used. To find the maximum number of tokens for the OpenAI model, refer to the ```max_tokens``` attribute provided on the OpenAI [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4) or API. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you’re using the GPT-3  model, the maximum number of tokens supported by the model is 2,049. The max tokens for different models depend on the specific version and their variants. (e.g., ```davinci``` , ```curie``` , ```babbage``` , or ```ada```) Each version has different limitations, with higher versions typically supporting larger number of tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to ensure that the input text does not exceed the maximum number of tokens supported by the model, as this may result in truncation or errors during processing. To handle this, you can split the input text into smaller chunks and process them separately, making sure that each chunk is within the allowed token limit. You can then combine the results as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might handle text that exceeds the maximum token limit for a given LLM in LangChain. Mind that the following code is partly pseudocode. It's not supposed to run, but it should give you the idea of how to handle texts longer than the maximum token limit."

    "In conclusion, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, driven by their few-shot learning and emergent abilities. These models excel in other tasks like text summarization and translation, often without the need for fine-tuning. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential pitfalls, such as hallucinations and biases, that can result in misleading or inaccurate outputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs can be a powerful creative asset, it is essential to be aware of their limitations and use them cautiously in cases requiring absolute accuracy. Furthermore, understanding the context size and maximum token limitations is vital to optimizing LLM performance. As we continue to develop and utilize LLMs, balancing their potential benefits with the need to mitigate risks and address their inherent limitations is imperative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson you’ll find a first introduction at developing applications leveraging LangChain."
