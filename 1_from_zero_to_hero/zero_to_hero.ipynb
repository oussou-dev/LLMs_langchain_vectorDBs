    "In LangChain, a chain is an end-to-end wrapper around multiple individual components, providing a way to accomplish a common use case by combining these components in a specific sequence. The most commonly used type of chain is the LLMChain, which consists of a PromptTemplate, a model (either an LLM or a ChatModel), and an optional output parser.\n",

    "3. Click on the \"Create API token\" button. Then, you should see a popup asking for a token name and an expiration date. By default, the token expiration date is set so that the token expires after one day from its creation, but you can set it further in the future if you want to keep using the same token for the whole duration of the course. Once you’ve set the token name and its expiration date, click on the “Create API token” button.\n",

    "- ```SerpAPI```: This tool is an interface for the SerpAPI search engine, allowing the agent to perform robust online searches to pull in relevant data for a conversation or task.\n",

    "If you wish to add more specialized capabilities to your LangChain conversational agent, the platform offers the flexibility to create ```custom tools```. By following the general tool creation guidelines provided in the LangChain documentation, you can develop tools tailored to the specific needs of your application."
